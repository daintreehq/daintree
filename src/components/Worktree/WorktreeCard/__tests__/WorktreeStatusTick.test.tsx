 * The card's status tick must not carry its meaning in colour alone
 * (WCAG SC 1.4.1). It is the only place on the card where `cleanup` and
 * `complete` are told apart at all, so if their fills were the whole
 * difference, nothing on screen would distinguish them for a reader who cannot
 * separate those two hues — and under `forced-colors`, where `.status-mark`
 * flattens every state to one system colour, for nobody at all.
 *
 * These assert the RULE — every state is distinguishable without hue — rather
 * than which count belongs to which state. The specific geometry is a design
 * decision and will move; that the states separate without colour is not.
