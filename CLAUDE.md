# Daintree

**Overview:** Electron-based IDE for orchestrating AI coding agents (Claude, Gemini, Codex). Features integrated terminals, worktree dashboard, panel management, and context injection. **Stack:** Electron 41, React 19, Vite 8, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, Zustand 5, node-pty, simple-git, @xterm/xterm 6.0, @xterm/addon-fit 0.11.

## Critical Rules

- **Dependencies:** Use `npm install` for local development. `npm ci` is acceptable for CI environments where reproducible builds are critical. Both commands run the `postinstall` rebuild hook automatically unless `--ignore-scripts` is used.
- **Native Modules:** `node-pty` must be rebuilt for Electron. The `postinstall` script handles this automatically. If errors occur, run `npm run rebuild`.
- **Code Style:** Minimal comments. No decorative headers. High signal-to-noise ratio.
- **Accent Color Restraint:** The accent color (`--color-accent-primary`, `text-accent-primary`, `outline-daintree-accent`, etc.) is a scarce resource, not a default highlight. If everything uses it, nothing stands out. Reserve it for _one_ genuinely load-bearing signal per active focus region — a strong focus anchor, a primary CTA. An active focus region is an independent focus trap or arrow-key navigation domain (macro layout zone, modal, popover, dropdown). See [Design review checklist](docs/themes/theme-system.md#design-review-checklist). Do NOT use it for: multi-select state, membership markers, secondary emphasis, "this is selected too" indicators, arming badges, or any treatment applied to multiple elements at once. For those, use the title-bar lift (`bg-overlay-subtle`), focus styling, or neutral surface differences. When in doubt, err on the side of NO accent — subtle wins.
- **Motion Timing:** Use the shared timing tiers unless the animation encodes semantic state. **Tier 1 — State changes (150ms `ease-out`):** hover, focus, active, selected, group-hover, toggle thumbs, drop-target rings, hover scrims, and other local UI feedback. Bare `transition-colors` (no explicit duration) inherits the app-wide 150ms default and needs no extra class; when a duration is required use `duration-150`. **Tier 2 — Deliberate entry/exit (200ms enter / 120ms exit):** modals, popovers, dropdowns, and surfaced dialogs. **Tier 2-fast — Palette/tooltip (150ms enter / 100ms exit):** command palettes and tooltips use a snappier sub-tier because typed-input flow expects faster response. **Tier 3 — Panel motion (200ms restore / 120ms minimize):** large-area choreographed reflow. Prefer the named constants in `src/lib/animationUtils.ts` (`UI_ANIMATION_DURATION` and `TERMINAL_ANIMATION_DURATION` for Tier 1; `UI_ENTER_DURATION`, `UI_EXIT_DURATION`, `UI_PALETTE_ENTER_DURATION`, `UI_PALETTE_EXIT_DURATION`, `PANEL_RESTORE_DURATION`, `PANEL_MINIMIZE_DURATION` for Tiers 2/3) when timing is expressed in TypeScript. **Semantic exceptions** — durations encoding meaning, not motion — must not be "fixed": `ActivityLight` 1000ms color fade (fade IS the decay indicator); progress bar 300–500ms width (width IS the progress signal); agent-state panel border 300ms (`ContentPanel` + `panel-state-*` classes — ambient, not jittery); welcome/empty-state hero fades 500ms (deliberately inviting); sidebar collapse 250ms `ease-out-expo` (large theatrical reflow); inline alert banner 200ms entry (`TerminalCountWarning`); diagnostics dock height 200ms; `FileChangeList` row-recency gutter bar 2000ms (`file-change-row-new` — the decay IS the arrival signal); `SettingsSwitch` asymmetric track/thumb (100ms thumb `ease-out-expo` + 200ms track `ease-out` — thumb leads to convey responsive feedback before the color crossfade catches up). Never widen scoped transitions (`transition-[width]`, `transition-[backdrop-filter]`, `transition-transform`, `transition-colors`) to bare `transition` or `transition-all`. **Property stacking —** Use the narrowest property set: simple hover color/background changes use bare `transition-colors`; surfaces that also animate `box-shadow` name each property explicitly — CSS longhand (`transition: color 150ms ease, background-color 150ms ease, box-shadow 150ms ease` in `src/styles/components/toolbar.css` and `src/styles/components/sidebar.css`) or the equivalent Tailwind arbitrary-value form (`transition-[color,background-color,box-shadow]`). Keep `transform` out of the press snap by one of two mechanisms: omit it from the CSS property list (toolbar-style), or include it but collapse the duration on press (button-style — `Button` in `src/components/ui/button.tsx` uses bare `transition duration-150` plus `active:scale-[0.98] active:duration-[1ms]`, so the scale snaps instead of stretching to 150ms). Non-press transforms may still interpolate (badge entrance, `PulseHeatmap` cells). Box-shadow either interpolates at 150ms in its own named slot or snaps with `active:shadow-none`, never both for the same state. Focus-ring transitions (`outline-color`, `outline-offset`, `box-shadow`) are wired once in `src/index.css` `*:focus-visible` with reduced-motion/forced-colors handled globally — components must not add `outline-*` focus transitions per-element. Avoid `transition-all`; it makes Chromium interpolate every computed property every frame.
- **High-Contrast Dual-Block Guard:** The `@media (prefers-contrast: more)` (`src/index.css:2727-2775`) and `@media (forced-colors: active)` (`src/index.css:2602-2725`) blocks in `src/index.css` are both mandatory and must never be consolidated. macOS "Increase Contrast" only fires `prefers-contrast: more`, not `forced-colors: active` (macOS has no forced-colors mode). Consolidating the blocks would either break Mac users (if forced-colors-only) or produce wrong visuals on Windows (if prefers-contrast-only with theme colors overriding the system palette). Rationale documented inline at `src/index.css:2727-2733`.
- **Loading Indicators:** Use the 400ms Doherty Threshold as the anti-flicker gate. **<400ms:** show nothing — drawing attention to a sub-threshold wait increases perceived load time. **400ms–1s:** use a skeleton (`animate-pulse-delayed`) when the layout shape is predictable; use `Spinner` only when the shape is unknown. **>1s:** skeleton mandatory when the shape is predictable. **>5s:** persistent skeleton plus a placeholder for a "Still working…" cue (exact copy decided separately). The default skeleton utility is `animate-pulse-delayed` (`src/index.css:1084`), whose `animation-delay: 400ms` enforces the gate automatically — elements stay invisible for 400ms, then fade in as a pulsing placeholder (`prefers-reduced-motion`, `data-reduce-animations`, and `data-performance-mode` bypass the gate by forcing `opacity: 1` / `animation: none`). `animate-pulse-immediate` (`src/index.css:1091`) skips the delay gate; reserve it only for cases where data is already known to exceed the threshold (e.g., in-flight network fetches). Canonical examples: `BrowserPaneSkeleton` (`src/components/Browser/BrowserPaneSkeleton.tsx`) for delayed-only, the exports in `GitHubDropdownSkeletons.tsx` (`src/components/GitHub/GitHubDropdownSkeletons.tsx`) for delayed + immediate variants. `Spinner` (`src/components/ui/Spinner.tsx`) has no built-in delay — never use it for sub-400ms waits or predictable-shaped content. `will-change: opacity` lives on the CSS utility class; never apply it per-element. `useDeferredLoading(isPending, UI_DOHERTY_THRESHOLD)` (`src/hooks/useDeferredLoading.ts`) is the canonical programmatic sub-400ms gate — it defers the loading indicator until the Doherty threshold elapses, avoiding flicker for fast resolutions. **Settings tabs:** render section chrome immediately; never use a full-area `Spinner` as a loading state. The tab's section header, labels, and empty or disabled form controls must be visible before the bridge call resolves — start from safe defaults and populate values when the promise settles.
- **UI Microcopy:** Sentence case for titles, buttons, labels. No periods on titles, headings, or button labels (use periods on multi-sentence body text). Single-clause subtitles also omit the trailing period; only use periods on subtitles that contain two or more sentences. Use unambiguous contractions (couldn't, didn't, can't). Drop "we" — write "Couldn't connect" not "We couldn't connect". Error toasts follow Title-Message-Action: title = concise verb-noun ("Connection failed"), message = 1-2 short sentences explaining why/how-to-fix, action = single contextual button (only when there's a real recovery action — no "Dismiss"). Destructive buttons use verb-noun labels ("Delete worktree", not "Delete" or "Confirm"). Toggle labels never change with state. Title names the thing; subtitle describes the behavior; the switch position conveys state. Confirmation dialogs: title is a sentence-case question naming the entity (`Delete 'foo'?`, not `Delete Foo`). Body states the specific consequence — never a generic "Are you sure". Button is verb-noun (`Delete recipe`). Recovery verbs are split deliberately: error-boundary fallbacks use `Try again` (the surrounding paragraph copy supplies the noun, so the verb alone reads cleanly); inline banners use `Retry` (the banner title already names the failed action, so a one-word button keeps the row tight). **Toast title form:** verb-led past tense ("Changes synced", "Token saved") when the user or system took a discrete action; noun phrase ("Connection lost", "Disk space low") for ambient state changes. **Body never restates the title** — the body explains the cause or names the recovery step; if neither adds information, omit the body. **Drop "successfully"** — past-tense alone signals success ("Editor opened", "Token saved", "Command completed"), the adverb adds filler without information. **Action-free error toasts:** when a `notify({ type: "error" })` truly has no recovery action (the surrounding UI is itself the retry surface — the form stays open, the user can re-invoke from the page), opt out of the `no-restricted-syntax` lint rule with `// eslint-disable-next-line no-restricted-syntax -- notify-no-action: ok` so the deliberate choice is documented at the call site.
- **Empty States:** First-run empty states name what the user can do next — they don't describe what's absent or list every option at once. Drive a single concrete action; when two regions are simultaneously empty (e.g. sidebar + content grid), only the canvas owns the primary CTA so the user isn't pulled in two directions. `RecipeRunner` is the first-run discovery path — surface it whenever there's an active worktree and the recipe store has settled for the current project (`useRecipeStore((s) => s.currentProjectId) !== null && !useRecipeStore((s) => s.isLoading)`); do NOT gate it on `hasEverLaunchedAgent`, since the recipe-based worktree spin-up is the value proposition new users should see first. The `isLoading` half of the gate matters because `loadRecipes()` sets `currentProjectId` synchronously before any IPC resolves, so `currentProjectId !== null` alone would flash `RecipeRunnerEmpty` ("Create your first recipe") while in-repo recipes are still in flight. Gate teaching content (rotating tips, shortcut carousels) on `hasEverLaunchedAgent` instead — derive it from `usePanelStore` by checking `launchAgentId | detectedAgentId | everDetectedAgent` across `panelIds` (mirrors `useGettingStartedChecklist` at `src/hooks/app/useGettingStartedChecklist.ts:45-55`). Completed-work empty states stay quiet — no quick-start lists, no contradictory ordered steps, no decoration competing with the existing `WelcomeScreen` + `GettingStartedChecklist` onboarding surfaces. Copy formulas by variant and scale: `filtered-empty` titles are noun phrases naming the result (`No matches for "{query}"` — `AppPaletteDialog.Empty`) and carry one recovery action (`Clear filters`, `Clear search`) when a concrete recovery path exists; at popover or palette scale omit the description when the filter or input already explains the cause, and prefer an inline text link over a primary button. Canvas or sidebar `zero-data` titles use an imperative verb phrase when there is one clear creation path (`Open a Git repository to get started` — `SidebarContent`); include a one-sentence description only when the cause is non-obvious (gated feature, missing token, permission), up to two sentences at full canvas scale. Toggle-gated feature panels use a stative title (`MCP server is off` — `McpServerSettingsTab`), a description framed as "Turn it on to …", and a single enable CTA reusing the same noun (`Turn on MCP server`); when the empty state lives outside the settings tab, the CTA routes to settings rather than firing the toggle inline. Connection- or token-gated panels use the parallel stative form (`GitHub not connected` — `GitHubResourceList`) with a CTA that opens the relevant connect flow. Popover and palette scales cap fixed-copy titles at ≤ 5 words (interpolated query text in `No matches for "{query}"` is exempt from the count), omit descriptions, and never use primary-weight buttons. Completed-result states use the `user-cleared` variant with past-result copy and no exclamation mark — canonically `You're all caught up` (`NotificationCenter`) — and never include an action (the variant nulls it at `EmptyState.tsx:35`).
- **notify() Usage:** Only emit for events the user could not otherwise observe: completion, failure, or required action. Before adding any `notify()` call, run the four-question forced-choice checklist: (1) **Timely** — does the user need to know now? (2) **Helpful** — is there a concrete next step? (3) **Visible another way** — is the result already self-evident in the UI? (4) **Ignorable** — if the user ignores it, can they still finish the current task? If yes, it's diagnostic; log via `console.warn` instead of notifying (precedent: commit `c41d0ab50` demoted the FD-leak warning to `console.warn`). The app has four delivery surfaces, ordered from least to most restricted: **frame indicator** (`panel-state-*` on `ContentPanel` borders — ambient working/waiting state), **grid-bar inline** (`placement: "grid-bar"` — bypasses priority routing and renders inline, subject to quiet-mode suppression), **notification inbox** (durable bell + history list), and **toast** (the default `notify()` placement — the **most-restricted** surface, not the default of convenience). Pick the least-restricted surface that conveys the signal. `priority: "low"` skips toasts and goes straight to inbox (except `placement: "grid-bar"` which always renders inline); don't use it for errors users need to see immediately — `notify({ type: "error", priority: "low" })` is **banned** (lint-enforced) because the toast is silently dropped. `message` as `ReactNode` requires `inboxMessage` or the history entry is silently dropped (`src/lib/notify.ts:380-408`).
- **Runtime Signals:** Use the lowest visibility tier that keeps the signal actionable. Escalating too aggressively trains users to ignore signals; under-signalling hides real failures. **Tier 0 — Silent log:** user can't act differently; informational only (FD-leak warning, `src/store/listeners/panel/fdLeakWarning.ts`, post-c41d0ab50). **Tier 1 — Ambient indicator:** observable, non-blocking state change on pane chrome (flow-status pill in `TerminalHeaderContent.tsx` for `paused-backpressure` / `suspended`; toolbar pips on assistant / agent / notification buttons — pip vocabulary documented in `src/styles/components/toolbar.css` under "Pip conventions"). **Tier 2 — Inline warning banner:** non-blocking risk or threshold warning with no immediate failure (`TerminalCountWarning` at `src/components/Terminal/TerminalCountWarning.tsx`). **Tier 3 — Inline error banner:** pane-local failure with recovery context (e.g. `TerminalRestartStatusBanner` exit-error variant, `TerminalErrorBanner`, `SpawnErrorBanner`, `ReconnectErrorBanner` in `src/components/Terminal/`). **Tier 4 — Global banner with recovery action:** multi-terminal or host-level failure requiring explicit user action (host-crash banner shipped at `src/components/Recovery/HostCrashBanner.tsx`, mounted via `src/App.tsx`). When the global host-crash banner is active (`backendStatus !== "connected"`), per-pane duplicate error banners with no distinct recovery path are suppressed. Audit heuristic: if the user can't take a different action than they would by ignoring the signal, demote one tier; if it affects multiple terminals, escalate one tier. Worked example: c41d0ab50 demoted the FD-leak warning from a toast to Tier 0. **Tier promote-trigger:** Auto-recovering states stay at Tier 1 — `paused-backpressure` recovers when the buffer drains; `paused-resource-governor` recovers when memory pressure eases; ambient pane chrome is sufficient. A state that stays in auto-recovery beyond 30s without progress, or exhausts retries, is no longer auto-recovering — promote to Tier 3. States requiring user-action recovery promote to Tier 3 with an inline error banner and a recovery action button (agent crash without auto-restart, file-write blocked by lock). If the failure affects multiple terminals (e.g. MCP auth revoked for all panes), promote to Tier 4 instead. "Actionable Notification" (Carbon) is origin context only — Daintree's Tier 3 inline error banner stays canonical.
- **Destructive Action Tiers:** Calibrate safeguards to reversibility × blast radius. Over-confirming routine actions trains users to dismiss dialogs without reading; under-confirming leads to incidents like #7880. **Tier D0 — Reversible local:** no confirmation, but the inverse must exist and be discoverable (stage/unstage, dock/maximize, send-to-background, commit before push). **Tier D1 — Local irreversible:** explicit `ConfirmDialog` with a verb-noun button — pane-local data loss that git/reflog can't recover (`terminal.kill`, `terminal.killAll`, `worktree.sessions.endAll`, `git.snapshotDelete`, recipe delete, project remove from list). **Tier D2 — Shared-state mutation:** `ConfirmDialog` + change preview before the mutation fires — anything that touches the remote or filesystem in a way that requires coordination to undo (`git.push`, `worktree.delete`, `worktree.resource.teardown`, force-push, merge PR, close issue, branch delete on a shared branch). The preview must show the actual content (diff, message, file list, target branch); a count alone is insufficient — #7880's silent-fallback commit message wouldn't have been caught by a count. **Tier D3 — Catastrophic blast radius:** `ConfirmDialog` with `typedNameTarget` so the user must type the entity name (delete repo, delete project with worktrees, teardown cloud environment, bulk-delete that crosses worktree boundaries). **Hard rules — these are non-negotiable for any destructive UI work:** (1) **No silent fallback defaults** — never substitute a derived value (commit message, branch name, file path) without showing it to the user first; commit submission gates on an explicitly authored message, not "ai-note OR last-commit-message" silent chain. This is the #7880 root cause; treat any "if X is empty, use Y" path on a destructive submission as a review blocker. (2) **`danger` metadata classifies the action's target tier, not just current wiring.** Setting `danger:"confirm"` is the _classification_ — it asserts "this is destructive enough to need a confirm gate" and produces two real behavioral effects: exclusion from `ActionService.repeatLast` eligibility and from the `useActionPalette` MRU rail. The matching `ConfirmDialog` at the call site is the _wiring_ — separately tracked in the per-action audit (`docs/architecture/destructive-action-safeguards.md`). Rule: **classification leads wiring.** If a `ConfirmDialog` is wired, the metadata MUST be `danger:"confirm"` (else the action leaks into MRU). The reverse — that `danger:"confirm"` always implies a currently-wired dialog — is the _goal state_ the audit drives toward; gaps are an open follow-up, not a silent contradiction. (3) **Direct `window.electron.*` IPC calls bypass `ActionService`** — when a component calls IPC directly for any D1–D3 action, the confirm dialog must be wired in the component (current pattern); this should be flagged at review and the IPC path documented in the audit (`docs/architecture/destructive-action-safeguards.md`). (4) **Bundled multi-step operations** (e.g., stage + commit + push) require either a preview/edit step between each phase or an explicit "commit and push" confirmation that names both operations and shows both the message and the diff — never a single button that chains writes silently. Reference: `src/components/ui/ConfirmDialog.tsx` is the canonical confirmation surface; `docs/architecture/destructive-action-safeguards.md` is the living per-action audit and follow-up issue index.
- **Codex MCP:** When calling `mcp__codex__codex`, always set `model: "gpt-5.5"`. Do NOT use any other model—ignore examples in the MCP definition like `o3`, `o4-mini`, etc. Only `gpt-5.5` is valid. Include file paths in prompts—Codex reads files directly and gives better advice when it can see the actual code.
- **Human-Review Label:** The `human-review` label marks issues that cannot be solved autonomously—they require a developer checking logs, observing runtime behavior, or making subjective UX judgments. Adding this label makes an issue 10-20x more expensive (human time vs agent time), so use it sparingly. Only apply when the issue genuinely requires human observation or iterative debugging that an agent cannot perform. Most issues should NOT have this label. When working issues, skip any labeled `human-review`.
- **GitHub Access:** Public repo `daintreehq/daintree` (https://github.com/daintreehq/daintree). Always use the `gh` CLI for all GitHub operations (issues, PRs, checks, releases, API calls). Do NOT use HTTP fetches or web scraping to access GitHub URLs—they will fail due to authentication. Examples: `gh issue list`, `gh pr view 123`, `gh api repos/daintreehq/daintree/issues`.
- **Branching:** Gitflow model. **All PRs must target `develop`—NEVER `main`.** Only release merges go to `main`.
- **Tracked Configs:** `.daintree/recipes/*.json` files are intentionally tracked in git—do not remove or gitignore them.
- **Agent Config Boundary:** Never modify user-owned agent configuration (`~/.claude/settings.json`, `~/.gemini/`, user hooks, CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md/GEMINI.md in user projects, any agent-native settings files). This includes additive CLI injection like Claude's `--settings` flag—adding hooks or config still changes the user's session behavior in ways they haven't opted into. If a capability requires altering user agent config, it's out of scope. Use passive observation instead (output parsing, OSC title sniffing, process-tree state, `AgentPatternDetector`-style regex). Precedent: #4100 removed app-owned "Agent Instructions" for the same reason—agent-native config belongs to the user.
- **Research Versions:** When researching issues (e.g., via Ask Google MCP), always specify the actual versions we use: **Electron 41 (Chromium 146 — `build.target` is `chrome146` in `vite.config.ts`; bump in lockstep on each Electron major upgrade)**, **@xterm/xterm 6.0**, **@xterm/addon-fit 0.11**, **React 19**. There are significant breaking changes between Electron 33 and 41 (e.g., `console-message` event signature changed in v35, `WebRequestFilter` empty `urls` array no longer matches all, macOS 11 dropped in v38, utility processes warn instead of crash on unhandled rejections from v37 — they crashed in v36 and earlier). Similarly, xterm 6.0 removed the canvas renderer addon, removed `windowsMode`/`fastScrollModifier` options, replaced the viewport/scrollbar with VS Code's implementation, and migrated the event system. Do NOT assume older documentation is still accurate—always research for the exact versions.

## Development

```bash
npm run dev          # Start Main + Renderer (Vite)
npm run build        # Production build
npm run check        # typecheck + lint + format
npm run fix          # Auto-fix lint/format issues
npm run package      # Distribute
npm run rebuild      # Rebuild native modules
```

### CI Testing Strategy

- **PRs / pushes:** Typecheck, lint, format, unit tests, and build on **Ubuntu only** (smoke on push only; no E2E; five performance budgets gate after build). `ci-ok` gate job is the sole required status check.
- **Nightly (2 AM UTC):** Full cross-platform CI on all 3 OSes (macOS + Linux + **Windows**): check + test + build + smoke + E2E core (all 3 OSes) + every `full-*` bucket (**macOS + Linux only** — Windows full takes ~5–6 hours) + E2E online (all 3 OSes) + E2E nightly memory-leak suite (**macOS + Linux only** — same reason). Auto-creates GitHub issue on failure (`nightly-failure` label).
- **Releases:** Three independent per-OS workflows (`release-macos.yml`, `release-linux.yml`, `release-windows.yml`, #8052), each triggered by the same `v*` tag and running its own full vertical slice (checks → unit tests → e2e → build → R2 upload → website notify). A failure or hang in one OS only delays that OS; the other two publish the moment they go green. Within each workflow, E2E core + online + **all six `full-*` buckets** gate that OS's publish — including Windows, because each `full-*` bucket auto-shards 4 ways inside `e2e.yml` (#8053), turning a ~39min serial Windows bucket into ~10min wall-time. The per-OS split + sharding make the pipeline failure-isolated at both the OS and within-OS bucket level.
- **E2E tiers:** `e2e/core/` smoke gates releases. The `full` tier is split into six domain buckets, each its own Playwright project: `full-terminal`, `full-worktree`, `full-presets`, `full-platform`, `full-panels`, `full-resilience`. Specs live in `e2e/full/<bucket>/*.spec.ts`. `e2e/online/` runs 3 agent-integration tests against real model APIs (gates releases). `e2e/nightly/` runs memory-leak detection (nightly only).
- **Bucket boundaries:**
  - `full-terminal` — PTY mechanics, scrollback, search, layout, recipes, output flood, context injection, fleet broadcast.
  - `full-worktree` — worktree lifecycle, project switching, git detection, cross-project flows.
  - `full-presets` — agent presets, recipes, onboarding, CCR.
  - `full-platform` — settings, persistence, a11y, keyboard, OS-shell surfaces, oauth, security.
  - `full-panels` — browser, dev-preview, portal, review hub, file viewer, drag-drop, action palette, toolbar chrome.
  - `full-resilience` — errors, IPC, crashes, races, perf budgets, diagnostics.
- **Unified E2E runner:** `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` is the single workflow that runs every suite. It accepts `suite` (the chosen Playwright project) and `test_file` (optional single-spec path). Valid `suite` values: `full` (meta — all six buckets sequentially on one runner; the workflow_dispatch default), `core`, `full-terminal`, `full-worktree`, `full-presets`, `full-platform`, `full-panels`, `full-resilience`, `online`, `nightly`.
- **Single-file E2E:** `gh workflow run "E2E Tests" --ref develop -f platform=linux -f suite=full-terminal -f test_file=e2e/full/terminal/core-terminal-search.spec.ts` — use this when fixing a specific flaky test. Pass the bucket whose `testDir` contains the file as `suite`, and the spec path as `test_file`.
- **Local E2E before push:** When adding a new E2E test or modifying a feature that has an existing E2E test, run that specific test (or its bucket) locally before pushing. Use `npx playwright test e2e/full/terminal/core-terminal-search.spec.ts` for a single file, or `npm run test:e2e:full-terminal` for the bucket.

## Architecture

- **Main (`electron/`):** Handles node-pty, git operations, services, and IPC.
- **Renderer (`src/`):** React 19 UI. Communicates via `window.electron`.
- **Shared (`shared/`):** Types and config shared between main and renderer.

### Actions System

Central orchestration layer for all UI operations. Provides a unified, typed API for menus, keybindings, context menus, and agent automation.

- `ActionService` (`src/services/ActionService.ts`) — Registry and dispatcher singleton
- 28 definition files in `src/services/actions/definitions/` (one per domain)
- ~308 built-in action IDs in `shared/types/actions.ts` — `BuiltInActionId`, `ActionDefinition`, `ActionManifestEntry`
- `dispatch(actionId, args?, options?)` — Execute any action by ID
- `list()` / `get(id)` — Introspect available actions (MCP-compatible manifest)
- `ActionSource`: "user" | "keybinding" | "menu" | "agent" | "context-menu"
- `ActionDanger`: "safe" | "confirm" | "restricted"
- **Categories:** agent, app, artifacts, browser, copyTree, devServer, diagnostics, errors, files, git, github, help, introspection, logs, navigation, notes, panel, portal, preferences, project, recipes, settings, system, terminal, ui, voice, worktree

### Panel Architecture

Discriminated union types for type safety:

- `PanelInstance = PtyPanelData | BrowserPanelData | DevPreviewPanelData` (`shared/types/panel.ts`)
- Built-in panel kinds: `"terminal"` | `"browser"` | `"dev-preview"`
- `panelKindHasPty(kind)` — Check if panel requires PTY process
- Panel Kind Registry (`shared/config/panelKindRegistry.ts`) — config/metadata shared between processes
- Panel Kind Modules (`src/panels/<kind>/`) — per-kind serializer, defaults factory, and component. Unified registry in `src/panels/registry.tsx`

### Multi-Window & Project Views

Each project gets its own `WebContentsView` with an independent V8 context, managed by `ProjectViewManager` (`electron/window/ProjectViewManager.ts`). LRU eviction reclaims views when memory is tight. Per-window services are scoped via `WindowContext.services` (PortalManager, EventBuffer, MessagePorts), while global services (PtyClient, WorkspaceClient) are shared across windows.

### IPC Bridge (`window.electron`)

Access native features via namespaced API in Renderer. 56 namespaces exposed via `contextBridge` in `electron/preload.cts`. Returns Promises or Cleanups. Key namespaces: `worktree`, `terminal`, `files`, `system`, `app`, `project`, `github`, `git`, `portal`, `commands`, `appAgent`, `agentCapabilities`, `mcpServer`, `plugin`.

## Key Features & Implementation

- **Panels:** `PtyManager` (Main) manages node-pty processes. `terminalInstanceService` (Renderer) manages xterm.js instances.
- **Worktrees:** `WorkspaceService` polls git status. `WorktreeMonitor` tracks individual worktrees. Per-view worktree stores backed by dedicated MessagePorts (`WorktreePortBroker`).
- **Agent State:** `AgentStateMachine` tracks idle/working/running/waiting/directing/completed/exited via output heuristics.
- **Context:** `CopyTreeService` generates context for agents, injects into terminals.
- **Actions:** `ActionService` dispatches all UI operations with validation and observability.
- **Resource Profiles:** `ResourceProfileService` adaptively selects Performance/Balanced/Efficiency profiles based on memory pressure, event loop lag, battery state, and worktree count.

### Custom Icons

Custom Daintree-specific icons live in `src/components/icons/custom/`. Lucide-style SVG components (24x24 viewBox, 2px stroke, round caps/joins, `currentColor`). Brand/agent icons in `src/components/icons/brands/`. Barrel-exported from `src/components/icons/index.ts`.

## Common Tasks

**Adding a new action:**

1. Add action ID to `BUILT_IN_ACTION_IDS` in `shared/config/actionIds.ts`
2. Create definition in appropriate `src/services/actions/definitions/*.ts` file
3. Action is automatically registered via `useActionRegistry` hook

**Adding IPC channel:**

1. Define in `electron/ipc/channels.ts`
2. Implement in `electron/ipc/handlers/` (domain-specific file)
3. Expose in `electron/preload.cts`
4. Type in `src/types/electron.d.ts`
