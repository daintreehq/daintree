# Destructive Action Safeguards

Living per-action audit and rubric for destructive UI surfaces. Triggered by #7880 (a single-click commit + push button that silently substituted a fallback commit message and required force-push recovery on `origin/develop`). Tracked by #7881.

This document is the **source of truth** for which actions are considered destructive, what safeguard each one currently has, and what should change. CLAUDE.md carries the abbreviated rubric ("Destructive Action Tiers"); this file is the long-form inventory and the index of follow-up issues.

## Rubric

Four tiers, calibrated to **reversibility × blast radius**. The boundary between tiers is not blast-radius count — it is _what the user has to do to get back to where they were_.

| Tier | Reversibility | Required safeguard | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **D0** | Reversible locally; inverse is one click away | No confirmation. Inverse action (undo, unstage, restore from trash, dock/maximize) must be discoverable. | `git.stageAll`, `git.unstageAll`, `git.commit` (before push), `terminal.trash`, `terminal.background`, `panel.focus`, fleet arm/disarm. |
| **D1** | Local irreversible; git/reflog cannot recover | Explicit `ConfirmDialog` with verb-noun button (`Delete recipe`, not `Delete`). | `terminal.kill`, `terminal.killAll`, `worktree.sessions.endAll`, `worktree.sessions.trashAll`, `git.snapshotDelete`, recipe delete, project remove from list, `keybinding.resetAll`. |
| **D2** | Shared-state mutation; recovery requires coordination (force-push, file restore, external tool) | `ConfirmDialog` + content preview before the mutation fires. Preview must show actual content (diff, message, file list, target branch) — a count alone is insufficient. | `git.push`, `worktree.delete`, `worktree.resource.teardown`, force-push, merge PR, close issue / PR, branch delete on a shared branch. |
| **D3** | Catastrophic blast radius; no recovery path | `ConfirmDialog` with `typedNameTarget` (user types entity name). | Delete repo, delete project with worktrees, teardown cloud environment, bulk delete crossing worktree boundaries. |

**Hard rules** (extracted to CLAUDE.md verbatim — duplicated here for the audit):

1. **No silent fallback defaults.** Never substitute a derived value (commit message, branch name, file path) without showing it to the user first. Commit submission gates on an explicitly authored message — not "ai-note OR last-commit-message" silent chain. This is the #7880 root cause; any "if X is empty, use Y" path on a destructive submission is a review blocker.
2. **`danger` metadata classifies the action's target tier, not just current wiring.** Setting `danger:"confirm"` asserts "this action is destructive enough to need a confirm gate" and produces two real behavioral effects: exclusion from `ActionService.repeatLast` eligibility (`src/services/ActionService.ts:301`) and from the `useActionPalette` MRU rail (`src/hooks/useActionPalette.ts:99`). The matching `ConfirmDialog` at the call site is the **wiring**, tracked separately in this audit's "UI confirm" column. Direction: **classification leads wiring.** If a `ConfirmDialog` is wired, the metadata MUST be `danger:"confirm"` (else the action leaks into MRU). The reverse — that every `danger:"confirm"` already has a dialog — is the _goal state_ the audit drives toward; gaps appear as TBD follow-ups, not silent contradictions.
3. **Direct `window.electron.*` IPC calls bypass `ActionService`.** When a component calls IPC directly for any D1–D3 action, the confirm dialog must be wired in the component. These bypass paths must be listed in this audit (see [Known bypasses](#known-bypasses)) and called out at review.
4. **Bundled multi-step operations** (e.g., stage + commit + push) require either a preview/edit step between each phase, or an explicit "commit and push" confirmation that names both operations and shows the commit message and diff. Never a single button that chains writes silently.
5. **Destructive primitive conventions.** Every destructive `ConfirmDialog` inherits the following from the primitive layer (`AppDialog` + `ConfirmDialog` + `TypedNameConfirmInput`) — consumers do not opt in:
   - **`role="alertdialog"`** on destructive variants (vs `role="dialog"`) so screen readers interrupt the speech queue. `aria-labelledby` / `aria-describedby` continue to wire the title and description.
   - **Initial focus on Cancel** for `variant="destructive"`. The Cancel button carries `data-confirm-role="cancel"` and the Confirm button carries `data-confirm-role="confirm"`; `AppDialog`'s focus effect targets the marker, falling back to the first tabbable element if the consumer renders custom Footer `children`. Override with `initialFocus="first" | "confirm" | "none"` when the destructive surface demands it.
   - **Cancel-left, Primary-right** button order (Apple HIG / modern web). Daintree deliberately diverges from Fluent 2's Primary-left layout — the destructive button is never the first thing the keyboard or pointer lands on.
   - **Typed-name gate** uses `aria-required="true"` and `aria-invalid` when the value is non-empty and unmatched, so assistive tech announces the gate state during the type-to-confirm flow.
   - **Dev-only microcopy guards.** `ConfirmDialog` `warnOnce`s on `title` starting with "Are you sure" and on body text containing "cannot be undone" / "can't be undone". Both rules sit on the entity-naming / specific-consequence requirements from CLAUDE.md and fire once per session.

## Audit table

Columns:

- **Action / call site** — action ID where it exists, otherwise the component path performing the operation
- **Current** — `danger` value in the action definition (or `(bypass)` for direct IPC calls)
- **UI confirm** — does the calling component wire a `ConfirmDialog` today?
- **Consent in breadcrumb** — does the action emit a `confirmed` value into the `ActionBreadcrumb`? `danger:"confirm"` actions emit a boolean (`true` when an agent explicitly confirmed, absent when user-source — `source:"user"` itself carries sufficient signal for dialog-confirmed actions). `danger:"safe"` actions emit `n/a` (field absent). Bypass paths: `n/a` (not routed through `ActionService`).
- **Reversibility** — local-undo / local-irreversible / shared-state / catastrophic
- **Blast** — typical scope per invocation
- **Tier** — recommended tier from the rubric
- **Recommendation** — leave alone / add confirm / add preview / split / spin off
- **Follow-up** — issue tracking the fix (TBD = to be filed after merge)

| `ReviewHubContent.tsx` `handleCommitAndPush(message)` | (bypass — chains `commit` + `runPush`) | yes (`CommitPanel` push confirm — every remote push gates on `ConfirmDialog` with branch pill + commit message preview + per-worktree opt-out, #8025) | Boolean via dispatch | shared-state | one branch on origin | D2 | Leave — wired model for bundled commit-and-push | — |
| `ForcePushConfirmDialog.tsx` `forcePushWithLease` | (bypass, but **dialog already wired**) | yes (`ForcePushConfirmDialog`) | n/a (bypass) | shared-state, recoverable only by lease check | one branch on origin | D2 | Leave — current implementation is the model for D2 confirms | — |
| `ReviewHubContent.tsx:896` `pullRebase` | (bypass, but **dialog now wired**) | yes — `ConfirmDialog` previews local-ahead vs incoming-behind divergence on the current branch before rebase (#8242); `git.pullRebase` action reclassified `safe`→`confirm` | Boolean via dispatch | local-irreversible until pushed (rebase can clobber) | one worktree | D1 | Done (#8242) — confirm + divergence preview wired at the ReviewHub call site | — |

| `worktree.delete` | confirm | yes (`WorktreeDeleteDialog`) | Boolean via dispatch | shared-state (working tree + branch on disk) | one worktree, optionally one branch | D2 | Leave — preview shows file count split (tracked vs untracked, see #4927) | — |
| `worktree.delete` with `force: true` | confirm | yes; force flag is a separate toggle in the dialog, escalates to typed-name gate | Boolean via dispatch | shared-state, may discard uncommitted work | one worktree | D2 → escalates to D3 when worktree has uncommitted tracked changes | Done (#8023) — `WorktreeDeleteDialog.isHighTier` escalates to the typed-name gate when `force && hasTrackedChanges` (in addition to protected branch / main worktree); uses `hasTrackedChanges` not `hasChanges` so untracked-only deletes don't escalate (#4927) | — |

| `terminal.kill` | **confirm** (updated #8245) | yes — context menu (local `ConfirmDialog`) and keybinding/palette (app-level `TerminalDestructiveActionConfirmDialog`); fires only when the terminal has a running agent session (`terminalHasRunningAgentSession`), bare PTY stays D0 | Boolean via dispatch | local-irreversible (PTY killed, scrollback lost) | one terminal | D1 | Done (#8245) | — |

### GitHub-side

The current GitHub action set is read-only (`openIssues`, `listPullRequests`, etc.) plus token management. No PR merge, no issue close, no comment-post is wired through `ActionService` yet.

| Action / call site | Current | UI confirm | Consent in breadcrumb | Reversibility | Blast | Tier | Recommendation | Follow-up |

| `github.openIssue` / `github.openPR` / `github.openCommits` / list / get queries | safe | n/a | n/a | reversible (navigation only) | navigation | D0 | Leave | — |
| Merge PR / close issue / dismiss review (future) | n/a — not yet exposed via UI | n/a | n/a | shared-state | one PR or issue on origin | D2 | When wired, must be `danger:"confirm"` from day one and ship with target-naming preview | open as needed |

### Recipes / plugins

| Action / call site | Current | UI confirm | Consent in breadcrumb | Reversibility | Blast | Tier | Recommendation | Follow-up |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `recipe.run` | safe | n/a | n/a | local-irreversible (spawns processes; not a content mutation) | one recipe → many terminals | D0 | Leave | — |

| `recipe.saveToRepo` (with `deleteOriginal: true`) | safe | yes (`RecipeManager.tsx` ConfirmDialog) | n/a | local-irreversible (original deleted) | one recipe | D1 | Leave — current pattern is correct | — |

| `useRecipeRunner.ts:386` `handleDelete` (RecipeRunner context menu) | (bypass) | none — calls store `deleteRecipe` directly, no `ConfirmDialog` | n/a (bypass) | local-irreversible | one recipe | D1 | Route through `recipe.delete` and wire a `ConfirmDialog` at the RecipeRunner call site | TBD |
| Plugin install / uninstall (future) | n/a — not yet wired | n/a | n/a | shared-state (filesystem + plugin host restart) | one plugin | D1 | When wired, `danger:"confirm"` + show plugin metadata before install/uninstall | open as needed |
| Plugin-contributed actions (user/keybinding/menu/context-menu source) | **`effectiveDanger`** — host-computed in `PluginService.registerPluginAction` from manifest permissions; raise-only (plugin's self-declared `danger` is advisory and can never lower it) | yes — `pluginConfirmStore` + `PluginConfirmDialog`, intercepted in `usePluginActions.toSyntheticDefinition` `run()` closure; renderer reads `effectiveDanger` (fail-safe `?? "confirm"`) for the synthetic `definition.danger`, so MRU exclusion + `repeatLast` ineligibility follow automatically | Boolean via dispatch | varies (plugin-defined) | one plugin's actions | D1 | Done (#8321) — classification leads wiring: a plugin holding `shell:exec`/`git:write`/`fs:project-write`/`fs:user-data-write`/`agent:invoke` forces `confirm`. Agent-source dispatch skips the dialog (MCP bridge already confirmed; `ActionContext.dispatchSource` signals this) | #8321 |

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| `devPreview.restartAndClearCache` | **confirm** | none yet — `ConfirmDialog` wired in sibling UI issue | Boolean via dispatch | local-irreversible (framework build caches `.next`/`.vite`/`.turbo` wiped; regenerate on next build) | one panel | D1 | `danger:"confirm"` classification set; wire `ConfirmDialog` at the UI call site | TBD (UI issue) |
| `devPreview.reinstallAndRestart` | **confirm** | none yet — `ConfirmDialog` wired in sibling UI issue | Boolean via dispatch | shared-state (`node_modules` removed; recovery requires a full reinstall, network + lockfile dependent) | one panel | D2 | `danger:"confirm"` classification set; wire `ConfirmDialog` + change preview at the UI call site | TBD (UI issue) |

### Recovery page (bypass — static HTML)

The emergency recovery page (`public/recovery.html`) is a zero-React surface loaded after a crash loop. It cannot use the React `ConfirmDialog` primitive — React itself may be the thing that's broken — so the confirm gate is implemented as a vanilla-JS Disclosure pattern (ARIA `aria-expanded` + `aria-controls` + the `inert` attribute) inline on the page. Focus moves to Cancel on expand and returns to the trigger on cancel.

| Action / call site | Current | UI confirm | Consent in breadcrumb | Reversibility | Blast | Tier | Recommendation | Follow-up |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `public/recovery-renderer.js` `btn-reset` → `RECOVERY_RESET_AND_RELOAD` | (bypass — static HTML, no `ActionService`) | **Yes** — inline Disclosure confirm section with panel-count + backup-timestamp preview (#8697) | n/a (bypass) | local-irreversible (`appState` overwritten; `cachedBackupSnapshot` nulled; backup file on disk survives) | one window's sessions + layout | D1 | Done (#8697) — confirm wired at the JS call site; IPC fires only after explicit confirm button click | — |

## Known bypasses

Direct `window.electron.*` IPC calls that skip `ActionService`. These are the highest-risk locations because the action's `danger` rating cannot gate them — the confirmation must live in the component itself.

| `src/components/Recovery/SafeModeBanner.tsx` | `app.resetAndRelaunch` (safe-mode restart) | **Yes** — `ConfirmDialog` with destructive variant + `logs.openFile` recovery (#8685) |
| `public/recovery-renderer.js` | `recovery:reset-and-reload` (emergency recovery page) | **Yes** — inline vanilla-JS Disclosure confirm with panel count + backup timestamp preview; React is unavailable on this surface (#8697) |

## Maintenance

- This document is the source of truth for which actions are considered destructive and what tier they belong to. Updates are part of any PR that adds a new destructive action, changes an `ActionDanger` value, or wires a new `ConfirmDialog`.
- When filing follow-up issues, link them in the **Follow-up** column. Closed follow-ups can be replaced with the merge commit SHA.
- Regression guard: `src/services/actions/__tests__/actionDefinitions.quality.test.ts` asserts that the actions listed in the test's `EXPECTED_CONFIRM_DANGER` set carry `danger:"confirm"`. Adding a new destructive action means updating that set and updating this table.
- Cross-reference: CLAUDE.md "Destructive Action Tiers" rule carries the abbreviated rubric; this document carries the full inventory.
