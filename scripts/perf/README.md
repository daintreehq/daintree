# Performance Harness

This directory contains the benchmark harness for app-level performance regression tracking.

## Modes

- `smoke`: fast PR guardrails
- `ci`: broader merge validation
- `nightly`: full matrix + soak coverage
- `soak`: long-run stress focus

## Commands

```bash
npm run perf:smoke
npm run perf:ci
npm run perf:nightly
npm run perf:soak
```

## Outputs

Artifacts are written to `.tmp/perf-results/`:

- `*.raw.jsonl` - per-iteration raw samples
- `*.summary.json` - aggregate stats + budget results
- `*.report.md` - human-readable report
- `latest-<mode>.summary.json` / `latest-<mode>.report.md`

## Baselines

Baselines are read from `scripts/perf/config/baseline.<mode>.json`.

Update baseline after accepted optimization work:

```bash
npm run perf:smoke -- --update-baseline
npm run perf:ci -- --update-baseline
```

## Manual cold-start

`npm run perf:cold-start` is a manual, one-shot cold-start sampler. It launches the packaged binary N times from a fresh profile, parses the NDJSON marks (`DAINTREE_PERF_METRICS_FILE`) after each run, and prints an aggregated p50/p95 table covering key phase durations, individual marks, and IPC round-trip timings per channel. No thresholds, no baselines, no CI gating.

Requires a packaged binary under `release/` — build one first with `npm run package` (or `npm run package:local` on macOS for an unsigned dev build).

```bash
npm run perf:cold-start                   # 5 runs, text table
npm run perf:cold-start -- --runs 10      # custom run count
npm run perf:cold-start -- --json         # structured JSON for diffing
npm run perf:cold-start -- --trace        # capture GPU/compositor traces
```

IPC sampling is forced to 100% for this command so per-channel stats are meaningful across a small number of runs.

The `main_window_shown` mark records the moment `win.show()` is called (when the OS is asked to map the window). It surfaces as the `boot → main_window_shown` and `main_window_created → main_window_shown` phase pairs, exposing the dom-ready-gated window-reveal wait the harness was previously blind to. A mark carries `meta: { fallback: true }` when the 5s dom-ready fallback timer fired instead of the normal dom-ready signal.

## GPU/compositor traces (`--trace`)

`--trace` makes the packaged app self-start Electron's `contentTracing` (categories `viz,gpu,cc,blink,toplevel,startup`) for the full startup-to-quit window, writing one trace per run to `.tmp/perf-results/trace-run-N.json`. This is the way to see why the compositor takes time between `main_window_shown` and the first painted frame.

The output is Chromium's JSON Trace Event Format — open it directly at https://ui.perfetto.dev (drag-and-drop the `.json` file, no conversion needed).

Tracing adds measurable overhead to the traced process, so `--trace` is opt-in and gated behind a second env flag (`DAINTREE_PERF_TRACE`) that normal runs never set. **Do not mix `--trace` runs into baseline timing numbers** — capture traces in a separate session. Trace files can be large (tens of MB) and are transient build artifacts under `.tmp/`.
